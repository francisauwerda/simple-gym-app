/**
 * Adding a Set
 *
 * When the user has input all their values they want to add a
 * set to the exercise. So I first need to save their data
 * into local storage and then I need to update the reducer to
 * display everything from that exercise.
 *
 * 1. Add set to local storage
 * 2. Fetch all exercises and update reducer

/**
  * Fetching the sets
  *
  * 1. Fetch all sets for this exercise from the local storage (fake this)
  * 2. Update reducer to display all of these sets.
  *
  * 1. User clicks on sets
  * 2. On componentDidMount all sets are fetched.
  * 3. When all states are fetched and inside the state then display them.
